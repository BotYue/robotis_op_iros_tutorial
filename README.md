In order to run ROS and the simulator on your personal notebook, please install Linux Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and ROS Indigo. Installation instructions can be found here: https://github.com/ROBOTIS-OP/robotis_op_documentation/wiki/Installation-on--PC
Thank you.

Objectives
 
The newly released ROBOTIS OP2, successor of the DARwIn OP, is a new kid size humanoid platform
manufactured by ROBOTIS. With additional computational power it enables the robot to run more complex
code on-board in real-time, for instance in the fields of computer vision or motion planning.
To allow an easy exchange of software features and to encourage collaboration ROBOTIS is working on
the support of the Robot Operating System (ROS), which provides an integration of several popular libraries as
MoveIt, OpenCV and the physics simulator Gazebo.
The tutorial session will start with an introduction on the basics of the OP2 and ROS. Afterwards, the participants
will have the opportunity to apply the new knowledge and work on a small ROS-based project with the OP2, both
in simulation and on the real robot.
The session will conclude with presentations showing up advanced possibilities, as how to utilize complex grippers
and transferring the knowledge to alternative open source platforms.
